Village Mission Statement: What We Are, In Short
================================================

A community to provide sustainable, low income cohousing.

Member Rights and Responsibilities: What You Have to Do and What You Get
========================================================================

Members of Dandelion Village are anyone who lives on or in properties that the
village owns or rents and/or who pays village dues of $66 per month. Members
are expected to attend bimonthly workdays and meetings and donate 10 hours of
their time to village work every month.

Members have full voting rights and may participate in consensus decision
making on all village decisions.  Members also have access to and use of
village property with in the bounds decided upon collectively by the village.

Village Structure: How we do things
===================================

Village decisions are made by consensus.  If consensus cannot be reached, then
village members may request a vote to override consensus on a topic.  If 80% of 
village members vote in favor, then the vote is considered passed.

Village workdays are held the 1st and 3rd Sunday of every month at 3 pm.
Village members briefly meet at the beginning of each workday to decide what to
accomplish before splitting to work on assigned tasks.  Towards the end of the
workday, one or more village members are assigned to make dinner for the rest
of the village.

Meetings are held the 1st and 3rd Sunday of every month at 6 pm (immediately
after the workday) at either Dandemonium or Bing End.  Meetings are generally
informal, but at need will be facilitated using the consensus method.

Village Rules: Things we don't do
=================================

Nothing here.

Miscellaneous Policies: Random Decisions We've Made
===================================================

Leases: Leases of village members will be at least 6 months in length.
Exceptions may be made for the small room.
